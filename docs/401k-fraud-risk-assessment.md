## The Fraud Triangle in 401(k) Plans

The fraud triangle identifies three conditions that are generally present when fraud occurs:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   INCENTIVE/    │
                    │    PRESSURE     │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
                             ▼
              Fraud occurs when all three
                 elements are present
                             │
         ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
         │                                       │
         ▼                                       ▼
┌─────────────────┐                    ┌─────────────────┐
│  OPPORTUNITY    │                    │ RATIONALIZATION │
└─────────────────┘                    └─────────────────┘
