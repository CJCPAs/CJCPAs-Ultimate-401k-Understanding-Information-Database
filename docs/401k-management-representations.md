## Common Representation Issues

### Issue: Management Refuses to Sign

**Problem:** Plan administrator or other management refuses to sign the representation letter.

**Resolution Options:**
1. Discuss the reason for refusal and address concerns
2. Modify the representation if supported by evidence
3. If modification not appropriate, consider:
   - Scope limitation
   - Withdrawal from engagement
   - Qualified or adverse opinion

**Professional Guidance:** AU-C 580.22-23 addresses management's refusal to provide representations.

---

### Issue: Management Cannot Make Representation

**Problem:** Management states they cannot make a particular representation (e.g., they don't know if all compliance tests were performed).

**Resolution Options:**
1. Discuss with management why they cannot make the representation
2. Perform additional audit procedures to obtain evidence
3. Modify the representation to reflect what management can represent
4. Consider scope limitation if evidence is not available

---

### Issue: Inconsistent Evidence

**Problem:** Audit evidence contradicts a management representation.

**Resolution Options:**
1. Discuss discrepancy with management
2. Perform additional procedures to resolve the inconsistency
3. Evaluate the reliability of management representations overall
4. Consider the effect on other representations
5. Consider the impact on the audit opinion

---

### Issue: Dating the Letter

**Problem:** The representation letter must be dated as of the audit report date, but management wants to sign earlier.

**Resolution:**
- The letter can be signed before the report date
- The letter must be dated as of, or immediately prior to, the report date
- If significant time passes between signing and report date, consider updating representations

---

### Issue: Appropriate Signers

**Problem:** Uncertainty about who should sign the representation letter.

**Guidance:**
- Plan Administrator (required)
- CFO or equivalent (financial statement responsibility)
- HR Director (participant data responsibility)
- Consider who has knowledge of specific representations
- Document rationale for signatories selected

---

### Representation Letter Red Flags

| Red Flag | Possible Issue | Action |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Significant changes from draft | Management may have discovered issues | Investigate changes |
| Long delays in signing | Hesitation may indicate problems | Discuss with management |
| Unwillingness to sign specific items | May indicate known issues | Perform additional procedures |
| Changes in management | New management may not have knowledge | Consider scope limitation |
| Last-minute changes to language | May be attempting to limit representations | Evaluate proposed changes carefully |
