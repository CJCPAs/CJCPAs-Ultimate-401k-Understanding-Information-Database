**[FIRM LETTERHEAD]**

[Date]

[Plan Administrator Name]
[Title]
[Company Name]
[Address]
[City, State ZIP]

**RE: Engagement Letter for the Audit of [Plan Name]**
**Employer Identification Number: [XX-XXXXXXX]**
**Plan Number: [XXX]**

Dear [Plan Administrator Name]:

This letter confirms our understanding of the terms and objectives of our engagement and the nature and limitations of the services we will provide.

#### Scope of Engagement

You have requested that we audit the financial statements of the **[Plan Name]** (the "Plan"), which comprise the statement of net assets available for benefits as of [December 31, 20XX], and the related statement of changes in net assets available for benefits for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

#### Type of Audit: Limited Scope

As permitted by 29 CFR 2520.103-8 of the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), the plan administrator has instructed us not to perform any auditing procedures with respect to the information prepared and certified by [Custodian/Trustee Name], the trustee of the Plan, except for comparing the certified information with the related information included in the financial statements and supplemental schedules.

Because of the significance of the information that we will not audit, we will not express an opinion on the financial statements and supplemental schedules taken as a whole. Instead, our report will state that:

1. The financial statements and supplemental schedules have been subjected to audit procedures applied in an audit of ERISA plan financial statements, and
2. The form and content of the certified information are presented in compliance with the Department of Labor's Rules and Regulations for Reporting and Disclosure under ERISA.

We will issue a report prepared in accordance with AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 136, *Forming an Opinion and Reporting on Financial Statements of Employee Benefit Plans Subject to ERISA*, as amended.

#### Auditor's Responsibilities

We will conduct our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Our audit will include procedures related to:

- **Contributions**: Testing participant deferrals, employer contributions, and the timeliness of contribution remittances
- **Benefit payments and withdrawals**: Testing distributions for proper authorization, calculation, and eligibility
- **Participant data**: Testing eligibility, vesting, and compensation used in benefit determinations
- **Participant loans**: Testing compliance with plan provisions and IRC Section 72(p)
- **Administrative expenses**: Testing for proper authorization and reasonableness
- **Compliance matters**: Evaluating compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and agreements that may have a direct and material effect on the financial statements

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, together with the inherent limitations of internal control, an unavoidable risk exists that some material misstatements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with GAAS.

In making our risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Plan's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Plan's internal control. However, we will communicate to you in writing any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control relevant to the audit of the financial statements that we identify during our audit.

We will also communicate to you (1) any fraud involving senior management and fraud (whether caused by senior management or other employees) that causes a material misstatement of the financial statements that becomes known to us during the audit, and (2) any instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations that we become aware of during our audit (unless they are clearly inconsequential).

#### Management's Responsibilities

Our audit will be conducted on the basis that you (management and, when appropriate, those charged with governance) acknowledge and understand that you have certain responsibilities that are fundamental to the conduct of an audit.

**Financial Reporting Responsibilities:**
- The preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements and supplemental schedules in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP)

**Plan Administration Responsibilities:**

- Administering the Plan and determining that the Plan's transactions are in compliance with the plan's provisions
- Maintaining sufficient participant records to determine benefits due or which may become due to participants
- Providing us with a substantially complete Form 5500 prior to completion of our audit procedures

**ERISA Compliance Responsibilities:**
- Maintaining a fidelity bond as required by ERISA Section 412
- Filing the Form 5500 with required attachments by the applicable deadline
- Providing required participant notices and disclosures
- Ensuring the Plan maintains its tax-qualified status

**Representation Letter:**
At the conclusion of the audit, you will be required to provide us with a written confirmation, in a representation letter, concerning the representations made to us during the audit, including, but not limited to:

- Acknowledgment of your responsibility for the financial statements
- Availability of all relevant information
- Completeness of transactions recorded
- Any known or suspected fraud
- Subsequent events
- Compliance with laws and regulations
- Communications from regulatory agencies
- Identification of related parties

- Obtaining and providing us with the certification from the trustee/custodian
- Evaluating whether the certification is complete and in proper form
- Comparing certified amounts to related information in the financial statements

**[FIRM LETTERHEAD]**

[Date]

[Plan Administrator Name]
[Title]
[Company Name]
[Address]
[City, State ZIP]

**RE: Engagement Letter for the Full Scope Audit of [Plan Name]**
**Employer Identification Number: [XX-XXXXXXX]**
**Plan Number: [XXX]**

Dear [Plan Administrator Name]:

This letter confirms our understanding of the terms and objectives of our engagement and the nature and limitations of the services we will provide.

#### Scope of Engagement

You have requested that we audit the financial statements of the **[Plan Name]** (the "Plan"), which comprise the statement of net assets available for benefits as of [December 31, 20XX], and the related statement of changes in net assets available for benefits for the year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

#### Type of Audit: Full Scope

This is a full scope audit. Unlike a limited scope audit, we will perform auditing procedures on all information in the financial statements, including investment information held by the trustee or custodian. We will express an opinion on the financial statements and supplemental schedules taken as a whole.

#### Auditor's Responsibilities

We will conduct our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

In a full scope audit, our procedures will include substantive testing of investment information, including:

- **Investment existence**: Confirmation or other procedures to verify investments exist
- **Investment valuation**: Evaluating the fair value of investments, including:
  - Investments with quoted prices in active markets
  - Investments valued using other observable inputs
  - Investments with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3)
- **Investment income**: Testing dividends, interest, and other investment income
- **Realized and unrealized gains/losses**: Testing investment transactions and year-end valuations
- **Investment transactions**: Testing purchases, sales, and other investment activity

In addition to investment testing, our audit will include procedures related to:

- **Contributions**: Testing participant deferrals, employer contributions, and the timeliness of contribution remittances
- **Benefit payments and withdrawals**: Testing distributions for proper authorization, calculation, and eligibility
- **Participant data**: Testing eligibility, vesting, and compensation used in benefit determinations
- **Participant loans**: Testing compliance with plan provisions and IRC Section 72(p)
- **Administrative expenses**: Testing for proper authorization and reasonableness
- **Compliance matters**: Evaluating compliance with applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and agreements that may have a direct and material effect on the financial statements

Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, together with the inherent limitations of internal control, an unavoidable risk exists that some material misstatements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with GAAS.

In making our risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Plan's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Plan's internal control. However, we will communicate to you in writing any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control relevant to the audit of the financial statements that we identify during our audit.

#### Management's Responsibilities

Our audit will be conducted on the basis that you (management and, when appropriate, those charged with governance) acknowledge and understand that you have certain responsibilities that are fundamental to the conduct of an audit.

**Financial Reporting Responsibilities:**
- The preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements and supplemental schedules in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP)
- The selection and application of appropriate accounting policies
- The design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error
- Identifying the framework used for measuring fair value of investments

**Plan Administration Responsibilities:**
- Maintaining and providing access to all plan documents, amendments, and summary plan descriptions
- Administering the Plan and determining that the Plan's transactions are in compliance with the plan's provisions
- Maintaining sufficient participant records to determine benefits due or which may become due to participants
- Providing us with a substantially complete Form 5500 prior to completion of our audit procedures

**Investment-Related Responsibilities (Full Scope Specific):**
- Evaluating and selecting appropriate fair value measurement methods
- Determining that the methods used are appropriate in the circumstances
- Maintaining adequate documentation to support fair value measurements
- Ensuring completeness and accuracy of investment information

**ERISA Compliance Responsibilities:**
- Maintaining a fidelity bond as required by ERISA Section 412
- Filing the Form 5500 with required attachments by the applicable deadline
- Providing required participant notices and disclosures
- Ensuring the Plan maintains its tax-qualified status

**Representation Letter:**
At the conclusion of the audit, you will be required to provide us with a written confirmation concerning the representations made to us during the audit.

#### Report

We will issue a report prepared in accordance with AICPA Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 136, as amended. Assuming no matters arise that would require modification of our opinion, our report will express an unmodified opinion on the financial statements and supplemental schedules.

#### Fees

Our estimated fee for the full scope audit is $[XXXX], based on our current understanding of the Plan's operations and the anticipated scope of work. This fee is [XX%] higher than a comparable limited scope audit due to the additional investment testing procedures required.

If we encounter circumstances that require us to perform procedures beyond the anticipated scope, we will discuss this with you before proceeding and provide a revised fee estimate.

#### Agreement

Please indicate your acceptance of these terms by signing below and returning one copy of this letter to us by [Date].

Sincerely,
