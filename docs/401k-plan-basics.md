## Do I Need a 401(k) Audit This Year?

This is one of the most common questions plan sponsors ask. The answer depends on your participant count and filing history. Here's how to figure it out.

### The Simple Answer

**If your plan has 100 or more eligible participants on the first day of the plan year, you generally need an audit.** But there's a transition rule (the "80-120 rule") that provides some flexibility.

### Where to Find Your Participant Count

Look at **Line 6g on your prior year Form 5500**. This shows the number of participants at the beginning of the plan year. For a calendar year plan, this is January 1st.

### The Decision Tree

Follow this flowchart to determine if you need an audit:

### Understanding the 80-120 Transition Rule

The DOL provides a **transition buffer** so plans don't bounce in and out of audit requirements:

| Scenario | Prior Year Filing | Current Participants | Audit Required? |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Growing plan | Small plan | 100-120 | **NO** - Can stay small |
| Growing plan | Small plan | 121+ | **YES** - Must file large |
| Shrinking plan | Large plan | 100-120 | **YES** - Must stay large |
| Shrinking plan | Large plan | 80-99 | **YES** - Must stay large |
| Shrinking plan | Large plan | <80 | **NO** - Can file small |
| Stable small | Small plan | <100 | **NO** - Stay small |
| Stable large | Large plan | 100+ | **YES** - Stay large |
| New plan | N/A (first year) | Any count | **NO** - First year exempt |

### Quick Reference Rules

1. **121+ participants = Always need an audit** (no exceptions)
2. **Under 80 participants = Never need an audit** (unless special circumstances)
3. **80-120 participants = Depends on prior year filing status**
4. **First year of plan = Generally exempt** (regardless of participant count)
5. **"Once large, stay large"** until you drop below 80 participants

### What Counts as a "Participant"?

For the participant count on Line 6g, count:
- Active employees eligible to participate (whether or not they contribute)
- Terminated employees with account balances
- Retirees receiving distributions
- Deceased participants' beneficiaries with remaining balances

**Do NOT count:**
- Employees not yet eligible (haven't met age/service requirements)
- Alternate payees under a QDRO (counted separately)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "We only have 95 people contributing" | Count **eligible** participants, not just those deferring |
| "We're at 115, we were 98 last year, no audit needed" | Correct! The 80-120 rule protects you |
| "We dropped to 85 from 130, we're under 100!" | Wrong - you need 79 or fewer to drop out of audit |
| "Our new plan has 200 employees" | First year is exempt, but next year you'll need an audit |

### Still Unsure?

When in doubt:
1. Pull your prior year Form 5500
2. Look at Line 5 (small plan checkbox) or Line 6g (participant count)
3. Count your current eligible participants as of 1/1
4. Follow the decision tree above

## Key Characteristics

### Defined Contribution Plan
- Unlike defined benefit (pension) plans, the benefit depends on contributions and investment performance
- No guaranteed benefit amount at retirement
- Risk shifted from employer to employee

### Tax-Advantaged
- Traditional contributions are pre-tax
- Roth contributions are after-tax but grow tax-free
- Employer contributions are tax-deductible to the employer

### Employer-Sponsored
- Must be established by an employer
- Cannot be established by individuals (unlike IRAs)
- Governed by plan document and ERISA

### Portable
- Employees can take vested balances when leaving employment
- Can roll over to another qualified plan or IRA
- Maintains tax-advantaged status

## How 401(k) Plans Work

### Contribution Flow

```
Employee's Paycheck
        ↓
Pre-Tax or Roth Election
        ↓
Deducted from Paycheck
        ↓
Deposited into 401(k) Account
        ↓
Invested per Participant Direction
        ↓
Grows Tax-Deferred (or Tax-Free for Roth)
        ↓
Available at Retirement (usually 59½)
```

### Participant Account Structure

Each participant has an individual account that may include:

1. **Employee Deferral Account**
   - Pre-tax contributions
   - Subject to annual limits
   - Immediately 100% vested

2. **Roth Deferral Account**
   - After-tax contributions
   - Subject to same limits as pre-tax
   - Tax-free growth and distribution

3. **Employer Match Account**
   - Employer matching contributions
   - May be subject to vesting schedule
   - Various match formulas possible

4. **Profit Sharing Account**
   - Discretionary employer contributions
   - Usually subject to vesting
   - Based on company profits or flat contribution

5. **Rollover Account**
   - Transferred from prior plans or IRAs
   - Always 100% vested
   - Maintains tax-advantaged status

6. **After-Tax Account**
   - Non-Roth after-tax contributions
   - May be allowed under plan
   - Enables "mega backdoor Roth" strategy

### Investment Process

1. **Plan offers investment menu** - Selected by plan fiduciaries
2. **Participant selects investments** - From available options
3. **Contributions allocated** - According to participant elections
4. **Periodic rebalancing** - May be automatic or manual
5. **Performance tracked** - Daily valuation typical
6. **Statements provided** - At least quarterly

## Tax Advantages

### For Employees

#### Traditional (Pre-Tax) Contributions
- **Immediate Tax Reduction**: Contributions reduce current taxable income
- **Tax-Deferred Growth**: No taxes on investment gains until withdrawal
- **Lower Current Tax Bracket**: May reduce marginal tax rate
- **Example**: $10,000 contribution at 24% bracket saves $2,400 in current taxes

#### Roth Contributions
- **Tax-Free Growth**: Investment gains are never taxed
- **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Qualified distributions are completely tax-free
- **No RMDs**: After SECURE 2.0, Roth 401(k) not subject to RMDs during owner's lifetime
- **Hedge Against Future Tax Increases**: Beneficial if tax rates rise

### For Employers

- **Tax Deduction**: Employer contributions are deductible business expenses
- **FICA Savings**: Employer portion of FICA not owed on deferrals
- **Recruitment Tool**: Competitive benefit attracts talent
- **Retention Tool**: Vesting schedules encourage tenure
- **Tax Credits**: Small employers may qualify for startup credits

### Tax Credit for Small Employers

Under SECURE 2.0, eligible small employers can receive:
- Credit for startup costs: Up to $5,000 per year for 3 years
- Credit for employer contributions: Up to $1,000 per employee for 5 years
- Available for employers with up to 50 employees

## Eligibility Requirements

### Minimum Statutory Standards

#### Entry Dates
- Must enter plan no later than earliest of:
  - First day of plan year after meeting requirements
